Need to:

- Display 16 cards (2 sets of 8 pair)
      - Create list/divs and append them to the DOM
- Randomize/shuffle the 16 cards for each game (prior to appending to DOM?)
- Allow user to select cards to flip
      - Only allow two flipped cards at any one time
      - Once the second card is flipped:
            - Determine if the two flipped cards match (create function to check for matching cards):
                  - If so, leave them flipped
                  - If not, turn them back over

- Apply styles for:
      - flipped cards
      - matched cards

- Create timer that displays during gameplay
- Create counter that display number of moves during gameplay
      - 2 clicks on a card equals one total move
- Create star rating area that dynamically updates during gameplay
      - At x number of moves remove one star
      - At y number of moves remove another star
      - At z number of moves remove final star

- Determine when the user has finished the game:
      - Check to see if all cards are matched
            - If all cards are matched, stop game
                  - If game is stopped, provide time elapsed and score with option to start new game
______________________
IN GAMEPLAY ORDER:

- Allow user to start the game
- Create card deck and shuffle/display it
- Start count of moves and start the timer
- Start function of star rating
- Provide function for user to click through cards
- Provide function to tell if flipped cards are matched
  - If so, style them differently and push them to the matched cards array
  - If not, flip them back over
- Allow user to move through to completing the game
  - Continually check for a finished game by checking if the matched cards array has 16 cards
- If the game has been completed:
  - Display to user the time elapsed, the total moves used, and a final star rating, with an option to restart the game or close the display box
